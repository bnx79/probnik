dialogue_1201=The American fleet is constantly harassing our coastal areas. Though they don't own many large ships, their privateers are big threats to our navy.
dialogue_1202=The British defense in the border has not yet been completed. This is a good opportunity for us to cooperate with navy and seize Canadian coastal areas.

dialogue_1407=The Holy Roman Empire is attacking Italy. The emperor ordered us to support and beat back the invaders.
dialogue_1408=The spy has caused a big fire in Prague. The city must be in chaos. Now it is the best time to attack.

dialogue_1417=I lead my troop to join the battle. Hope we can help you.

dialogue_1501=The enemy has a large scale of naval forces with far more ships than ours. We can not advance rashly if we want to win.
dialogue_1502=Take advantage of quick speed and more guns and destroy the Russian fleet at one strike.
dialogue_1503=Commander, please give priority to the enemy's flagship. If we defeat it, the whole Turkey fleet will be in chaos.
dialogue_1504=The enemy's fleet has completely lost moral, and now it is the time to launch an all-out attack.
dialogue_1505=The Turkey army launched a surprise attack on our cities near Caucasus. This is a good chance for us to expand.

dialogue_1507=Commander, please control Caucasus and destroy the enemy's main force.
dialogue_1508=The enemy's marching speed is astonishing. Soldiers, retreat to Trabzon and attack from the rear by waterway.

dialogue_1523=Our reinforcements have arrived at the battlefield. Now we need to speed up our marching.
dialogue_1524=The French army's fortifications are too strong for us to break through with our existing forces.
dialogue_1525=Our reinforcements are coming. My troop will try to hold the enemy's main force.
dialogue_1526=Commander, please avoid the enemy's main force and march directly to Paris.
dialogue_1527=The Greek Independence has created a prime opportunity for the Russian invasion. Luckily, we have deployed line of defense on the eastern side of Trabzon.

dialogue_1529=My troop has fought to the last minute, but still failed to contain the Russian attack.
dialogue_1530=The Ottoman rule in the Balkans has been precarious. Our attack will be their last straw.

dialogue_1532=The power of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans has been completely disrupted, but our troop has also paid a heavy price.
dialogue_1533=Istanbul must never fall into the enemy's hand. We must seize our lost land and restore our past glory.
dialogue_1534=Our ally seems hard to resist the enemy's attack. Commander, please occupy the enemy's stronghold before they are completely defeated.

dialogue_1604=My troop has failed to resist the enemy's continuous attack. Now we are quite passive.
dialogue_1605=The enemy has completely lost morale. Put yourselves together and leave the enemy no time to break.
dialogue_1606=The Russian army is advancing very fast. If we do not send reinforcements, the consequence will be terrible.
dialogue_1607=The Ottoman Empire has launched a comprehensive crackdown on the revolution. We must rely on Russia's power to contain the enemy.
dialogue_1608=We have got in touch with the revolutionary army. Once we join forces, it will be very hard for Turks to repress the independence movement.
dialogue_1609=The enemy is trying to encircle my troops. It seems like I have to be ready for retreat.
dialogue_1610=The alliance's fleet has moved. We must suppress the northern turmoil before they finish assembly.
dialogue_1611=We can't wait for the alliance. My troops should take the initiative and attack the enemy from the south in order to relieve the pressure of the revolutionary army.
dialogue_1612=All troops shorten line of defense! Wait for the alliance to come!
dialogue_1613=Our troop branched out and launched attack on Ottoman from the Balkans Peninsular and Caucasus. Before the French army arrives, we must expand our victory as much as possible.
dialogue_1614=Hold our line of defense! Once the French army finishes assembly, we will launch a counterattack on the enemy's hinterland by waterway.

dialogue_1701=Our reinforcements are coming. Strengthen the defensive forces around Yorktown and delay the enemy's attack as far as possible.

dialogue_1703=Our aim is to intercept the British reinforcements and allow the siege troops to successfully occupy Yorktown.
dialogue_1704=The French has deployed coastal artillery. We need to avoid them as much as possible and give priority to attack enemy's warships.
dialogue_1705=Commander, if you allow, my fleet will serve as your pioneer to attack the enemy.
dialogue_1706=We have found the British ships and we have the advantage of costal artillery. Once they are close, fire at full blast.
dialogue_1707=There is an ambush. Order the herald immediately to send the message for support of the Nelson fleet.
dialogue_1708=Follow my order. All ships full advance and break the enemy's formation. I will sink all their ships down.
dialogue_1709=This is our last offer. Surrender and hand over the command of all fleets.
dialogue_1710=This is the same as declaring war. We can not promise such barbarous demands.
dialogue_1711=Keep on attacking. I hope I would never see Danish warships again on the battlefield.
dialogue_1712=All ships join the battle. Show the British our resolve!

stage_intro_10004=In this level, we will show you the auxiliary fighting functions in the game, including wonders, military tactics, princesses and so on.
stage_intro_11001=The relationship between colonial America and the British government worsened after Coercive Acts. Conflicts with local militia broke out in Lexington in April 1775 when Britons marched towards Concord and triggered later events.
stage_intro_11002=Two months after Lexington, Continental Congress made George Washington commander and besieged Boston for months. In March 1776 after the arrival of artillery at Dorchester heights, the final battle against the British was imminent.
stage_intro_11003=William Howe, British commander in North America, suffered a humiliating defeat in Boston. In July 1776, the returning British attacked New York by sea and won a serial of battles, which cost the Continental Army heavily.
stage_intro_11004=The Continental Army stationed in Saratoga led by Horatio Gates was attacked in September 1777 by the south-marching British army who occupied New York. Since they had started to attack Philadelphia, blocking them became a top priority.
stage_intro_11005=The Continental Army was preparing to retake Savannah since the loss of the port city and in September 1779 they began to attack Savannah with French aid. However, the British had already strengthened defense by building fortifications.
stage_intro_11006=In September 1781, the French navy on the Caribbean Sea decided to move north to support American and French troops in Virginia. When arrived at Chesapeake Bay, the fleet met the British marching south and a maritime battle began.
stage_intro_11007=In August 1781, American and French troops marched fast to the south after deciding to attack York Town. In December, with the navy crushed and the chance of retreating gone, British commander Charles Cornwallis had to order defense. 
stage_intro_11008=Conflicts along America-Spain border got worse after Americans took Louisiana. Local aborigines, pushed and helped by the Spanish, also attacked frequently. So America started a plan to eliminate border threats once and for all.
stage_intro_12001=Conflicts between America and Britain had never stopped after War of Independence. In June 1812, America turned to Canada and attempted to control the whole north America by occupying Canada and expanding north.
stage_intro_12002=British and Canadian troops gained steady supply by St. Lawrence river, making American attack on Montreal useless. So knowing the U.S. would cut the line between Montreal and Quebec, they decided to strengthen land and water defense.
stage_intro_12003=With Napoleon dethroned, Britain moved its focus to the American continent. This led to an early attack on the upper Canadian region by Americans, who thought the place was defenseless without British support.
stage_intro_12004=After gaining strong British aid, Canada launched a counter-attack against America. In August 1814, the British and Canadian troops won the battle of Bladensburg and began preparing to attack the U.S. capital Washington.
stage_intro_21001=In August 1793, aided by royalists, the anti-French coalition successfully took Toulon. Facing the crisis, the French began to fight back, trying to retake the city. In December, the French led by Napoleon started its final attack.
